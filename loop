#you can loop through a dictionary by using a for loop.
#when looping through a dictionary, the return value are the keys of the dictionary, but there are methods to return the values as well.

#print all keys in dictionary
for x in dict:
  print(x)

#print all values in dictionary

for x in dict:
  print(dict[x])


#we can use values() to get the values

for x in dict.values():
  print(x)

#we can use keys() to get the keys

for x in dict.keys():
  print(x)

#we use items() to get keys and values

for x,y in dict.items():
  print(x,y)

#we cannot copy a dictionary by typing dict2 = dict1, because: dict2 will only be a reference to dict1, and changes made in dict1 will automatically also be made in dict2.
#There are ways to make a copy, one way is to use the built-in Dictionary method copy().

dict = {
"year": 2000,
"color":"blue"
}

dict1 = dict.copy()
print(dict1)

#another way is to use dict()
dict = {
"year": 2000,
"color":"blue"
}

dict1 = dict(dict)
print(dict1)
